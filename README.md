# Dying Dreams - (In)complete Edition

This is a "complete" post-compo version of my js13k (2022) game ([link to original](https://github.com/jani-nykanen/dying-dreams)).


------

# Building

Run `make js` to build in the watch mode, or `make js_full` without watch mode. `make dist` will build the project and make a zip archive for you.

# License


## Assets

- Music (excluding `victory.ogg`) (c) 2022 H0dari, do not use without composer's permission (so if you make your own fork, it is adviced to replace the music with your own)
- Everything else: go nuts. Just give a credit (if you don't, I will... uh, do nothing) and do not use them in a commercial product.

## Code

- The code is so horrible you can do whatever you want with it. Just don't claim that you wrote it (unless you rewrite, say, at least 90% of the code)
